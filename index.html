<h1>A history of surfing</h1>

<h2> Ever since the most famous moment in surfing history at this year’s J-Bay Open, it seems that sharks have been angling their cold, dead eyes towards the surfing community. We are facing our own personal Sharknado, and it’s high time we did something about it. I don’t mean a massive slaughter. I understand the integral role the shark plays to our ecosystem as an apex predator, and I respect it. I just can’t understand why anyone could ever value the life of a fish over the lives or safety of human beings, or any other mammal, for that matter. And I see nothing wrong with the targeted extermination of aggressive sharks in and around areas where there is a high density of recreational water users.</h2>
